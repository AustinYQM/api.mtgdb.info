api.mtgdb.info beta

A card database API for "Magic: The Gathering". Ultra simple. Open source. JSON API to create your own "Magic: the gathering database".


New release coming in Feb. 2014. There are some changes in the JSON formatting. It will follow the google guildlines for JSON. Guidelines here This is going to break code using the old format. The new format is available now. We will be locking this format, and there will be no field format changes in the future. Yes fields will be added, but the naming and format will not change.
